  "tagline": "A base application template for an AngularJS single page application, with gulp build tasks and test runner.",
  "body": "This is a simple application template. There is a very bare bones single page [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) 1.5 application, written with ES2015. It includes [UI-Router](https://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router), [UI-Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), and [Angular-Block-UI](https://github.com/McNull/angular-block-ui). The build process utilizes many separate [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com) tasks doing everything from compiling a stylesheet from custom [LESS](http://lesscss.org) to transpiling the ES2015 with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), to pulling it all together with [Browserify](http://browserify.org) and [gulp-usemin](https://github.com/zont/gulp-usemin), sourcemaps and all.\r\n\r\n### Pre-Requisites\r\n- [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org)\r\n- [Bower](http://bower.io)\r\n\r\nAll app source is located in the 'src' directory at the root of this project. All gulp tasks are located in the 'gulp/tasks' directory. When built, final code resides in the 'dist' directory.\r\n\r\n### Get Up And Running\r\n- Download the template via the [zip file download](https://github.com/cutterbl/cc-base-app-template/archive/master.zip)\r\n- At a command line prompt, run 'bower install'\r\n- At a command line prompt, run 'npm install' (use sudo if necessary)\r\n- At a command line prompt, run 'gulp'\r\n\r\nThe 'gulp' command will run the default task, building the project from source and starting a local node server on port 8080.\r\n\r\nRunning 'gulp test' will run jasmine tests located in the 'src' directory.\r\n",
